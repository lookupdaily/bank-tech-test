### Requirements

A programme which allows a user to make deposits or withdraw money from their bank account. The user is able to print a statement of recent deposits and withdrawals and the account balance.

### Acceptance criteria

- **Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012

- **And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
- **When** she prints her bank statement

```
date || credit || debit  || balance
